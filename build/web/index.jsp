                   Data mining can be used to model crime detection problems. About 10% of the criminals commit about 50% of the crimes. 
                   Data mining technology to design proactive services to reduce crime incidences. Crime investigation has very 
                   significant role of police system in any country. Almost all police stations use the system to store and retrieve the 
                   crimes and criminal data and subsequent reporting. It become useful for getting the criminal information but it does 
                   not help for the purpose of designing an action to prevent the crime. It has become a major challenge for police system
                   to detect and prevent crimes and criminals. Our system will predict Criminals which have high probability for doing 
                   crime. With the increasing advent of computerized systems, crime data analysts can help the Law enforcement officers 
                   to speed up the process of solving crimes. Using the concept of data mining we can extract previously unknown, useful 
                   information from an unstructured data. Here we have an approach between computer science and criminal justice to 
                   develop a data mining procedure that can help solve crimes faster. Instead of focusing on causes of crime occurrence 
                   like criminal background of offender, political enmity etc we are focusing mainly on crime factors of each day and by 
                   knowing the criminal background, his occupation, education, family background and friend circle we can predict that the
                   person can do the crime or not.
